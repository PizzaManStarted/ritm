# $\texttt{RITM}$ : *R*ead *E*val *P*rint *L*oop

## How to run

* To run the crate simply use the `cargo run` command inside the directory containing the REPL.

* To create a binary file to share with people using the same OS :
  1. Use the command : `cargo build --release`
  2. Then execute the file : `../target/release/ritm_repl`

## Default commands

The following commands are always accessible. 

If not already done, don't forget to read to first [README.md](../README.md) file since it contains some important informations related to some issues you might face.

### Print help

There are two types of help.

By simply typing `help` or even `h`, you will be shown the list of available commands that you can access.

By typing the same as above but following it with a positive integer (like for example : `help 0` or `h 2`) you will get a more in depth help/explanation of what the command with the given index can do.


### Clear screen

By typing `clear` or even `cl`, you can *clear* the terminal. 

### Quit program

And finally typing `q`, `quit`, `exit` or even `leave`.

You can safely exit the program. But beware that nothing will be saved, including the eventual turing machine you are working on, so don't forget to save it before leaving !



## 1) Load/Create Turing Machine Graph

In this mode you can either create a new empty turing machine graph or load an existing one. Both options will lead to the [graph modification mode](#2-modify-turing-machine-graph).

### Create

Creating a blank graph is as easy as specifying the number of working ribbons that you will be working with.

This is because every transitions will have to respect this value when you will add them later.

> [!NOTE]
> A blank graph consists of three default states :
> * $q_i$ : The **initial** state where every execution will start from.
> * $q_a$ : The **accepting** state where an execution should end to *accept* an input.
> * $q_r$ : The **rejecting** state. This state can be use to directly *reject* an input.

### Load

To load a graph that is already saved in a text file, simply specify the path to this machine. 

This path can be **absolute** or even **relative** to where the REPL was executed from.


## 2) Modify Turing Machine Graph

### Print a summary of the Turing Machine

This command will simply display a *summary* of the current graph that you are editing. 

> [!NOTE]
> This summary includes : 
> * The states present in the machine and their type
> * All the transitions contained in the machine per pair of states.

The latter can be copied to an external text file in order to *save* this graph for later uses.

### Add a state

Adds another **normal** state to the graph.

### Add one or multiple transition

Use this command to append one or multiple transition between two states. 

> [!TIP]
> If one of the given state does not currently exists, then it will be **automatically** added.  

The inputs must respect the parser rules for transitions. 

For example :
* Adding **one** transition between $q_i$ and $q_1$ : `q_i {ç, ç -> R, ç, R} q_1`
* Adding **four** transitions between $q_2$ and $q_2$ : `q_2 { 0, 0 -> N, 0, L | 0, 1 -> N, 1, L  | 1, 0 -> N, 0, L  | 1, 1 -> N, 1, L } q_2`

### Remove one or multiple transition

Remove one or multiple transitions matching the ones given as inputs.

### Remove a state

Removes the given state and **any** mention of it inside the graph.


This means that every transitions leaving or entering it will also be removed.

> [!WARNING]
> It is not possible to remove any of the default states of the graph like $q_i$, $q_a$ or even $q_r$.

### Save this TM as a file

Use this command to save the turing machine you are working with as a text file (by default it will add a `.tm` extension but you can change it as you desire).

The program will propose you a default path. This path will be current current one, but you can change it to fit your needs.


### Feed a word and start executing this Turing Machine

Feed a string to the turing machine and start executing it. This leads the program to the [execution mode](#3-execute-turing-machine).

> [!WARNING]
> The word cannot contain any special symbols like `$`, `ç` and `_`. And empty string are not accepted. 



### Unload the current Turing Machine

Delete the current graph and goes back the [first mode](#1-loadcreate-turing-machine-graph).



## 3) Execute Turing Machine

This mode covers everything related to the execution of a turing machine for a given input.

> [!NOTE]
> An iteration is when a transition is taken or when backtracking occurs. 

### Move to next step

Go to the next iteration if any are still left.

### Skip multiple steps

Advances the execution for a specified number of steps and prints the last iteration.

If the execution finishes before the desired number of steps, then the last iteration is still printed. 

### Execute at a given speed the TM

Will go to the next iteration every number 

> [!CAUTION]
> Please be aware that some turing machines are able to loop forever. Meaning this command can also never stop. But you can leave by simply pressing : $\texttt{CTRL+C}$



### Finish the execution (can loop forever)

Goes to the last iteration of the execution.

> [!CAUTION]
> Please be aware that some turing machines are able to loop forever. Meaning this command can also never stop. But you can leave by simply pressing : $\texttt{CTRL+C}$


### Iterate over the correct path, if any (can loop forever)

When working with *non deterministic* Turing Machines, we often think about the concept of ***guessing*** the correct value between steps.

This command will try to completly execute the given input. And if the input leads to an **accepting** state, then it will only keep the iterations that lead to this state without the need of backtracking. 


> [!CAUTION]
> Please be aware that some turing machines are able to loop forever. Meaning this command can also never stop. But you can leave by simply pressing : $\texttt{CTRL+C}$


### Reset the execution

Goes back to the first iteration.

### Feed a new word and reset

Changes the current input of the turing machine with a new word and resets the execution.

> [!WARNING]
> The word cannot contain any special symbols like `$`, `ç` and `_`. And empty string are not accepted. 


### Toggle on/off clearing after each step

Toggles wether or not, the screen should be cleared after printing an iteration.


### Sets the execution mode



### Print a summary of the graph

Prints a summary of the graph used for the execution. The summary is the same as explained in this [section](#print-a-summary-of-the-turing-machine).

### Print a summary of the execution



### Stop the execution

Goes back to the [graph modification mode](#2-modify-turing-machine-graph).
